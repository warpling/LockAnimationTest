# ðŸ”“ iPhone FaceID Unlock Animation

I made this for a thing I was messing around with in [Blackbox](https://blackboxpuzzles.com). Hopefully it serves as a bit of an example of how to pick apart and rebuild fun little animations like this one. 

Do with it what you will and please for the love of iOS let me know how I could be doing this better. ðŸ’žðŸ”“
